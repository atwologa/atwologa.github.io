    <p>Although loathed by most they are a necessary part of enhancing.  They are given as
    quest rewards, rift rewards, etc.  They can also be purchased from certain blacksmiths for 2,000,000 silver a pop.  By using cron stones on weapons/armor you prevent the grade from dropping down one on DUO and higher.
  With accessories there is still a chance of dropping but the item wont be destroyed.  The cost of this protection ranges greatly up to and over 1k stones.</p>
