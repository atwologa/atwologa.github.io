  way you want to be treated.  Be kind, dont hold grudges, show respect, and help others.  I promise you it will be paid in kind.
"For Jesus said, "As I have loved you love one another.""  Just because someone has a different relision or believe from you doesn't
mean you cant learn a great deal from them, respect all believes and learn what helps you grow closer to Christ and God.</p></div>
