  <div id = "sidepanel"><p>The message of the month is that you should always treat others the
  way you want to be treated.  Be kind, dont hold grudges, show respect, and help others.  I promise you it will be paid in kind.
"For Jesus said, "As I have loved you love one another.""  Just because someone has a different relision or believe from you doesn't
mean you cant learn a great deal from them, respect all believes and learn what helps you grow closer to Christ and God.</p></div>
<div id = "one"><p><bold><u>NEOVERSE</u></bold><br><br>This is a fantastic game that I Just disocovered a few weeks ago, essentially you must build a deck of cards
and fight enemies.  There are 3 characters to choose from in this game basically a fighter, summoner, and paladin.  Each with unique cards and
abilities.  The first of the three focuses on shooting and decay skills.  The second faith and vamparism although I've found
that the two don't work harmoniously together.  The third summons an ally for ferocious attacks.</p></div>
   <div id ="two"><p><bold><u>NOITA</u></bold><br><br>This game is really cool.  I havent had the chance to delve very deeply into it.  No pun intended.
   But every pixel can be burned, frozen, destroyed, melted, drained, or alteredd in some way shape or form it is truely incredible.  From what I can
 tell you play a little wizard guy and the entire goal of the game is to go as deep down as you possibly can witht the enemides getting stronger and stronger
as you go.</p></div>
     <div id = "three"><p><bold><u>Port Royale 3</u></bold><br><br>This game is all about trading and ship battles.  Its incredibley fun to organize a fleet of ships and command them
     to make money for you while you go around doing the same.  The game takes place in the Carribean and I think its fair to note that you are also able to take ownership
   over the various islands and develop them into whatever you want.  Meaning manufacturing goods etc.  There is a campaign and a free play mode.  Multiplayer is also a viable option.</p></div>
<div id = "four"><p><bold><u>Tainted Grail</u></bold></p>This game is another deck builder with over 8 classes to choose from.  The classes are unloced simply by playing and ever single class
has a very different play style from summoner, to blood mage, to setinal, to berserker and more.  The only catch is you prettyt much have to beat the game in one go meaning if you kill the first boss
and then die to a mob in the second area you have to start over and re-kill the first boss again.  Once you've figured out how to do it though with your particual class it isn't a big issue.  Annoyoing
but not really a problem.</div>
